- 👋 Hi, I’m @LadyHira
- I am old, boring and currently not in the mood to live. So I want to learn how to code and make my life more difficult so that I can blame all my problems to everyone but me.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and studying something new all the time. I am usually possessed by the LazyBitch, BrilliantChef, ProductiveWench and StudiousWitch. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS SysOps. I hate it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I don't like people. Don't talk to me.
- 📫 How to reach me...well try not to. I don't already like you. But you can direct your email to hirathameem270804@yahoo.com - all new emails are forwarded to the junk anyways
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't have much to like or love or hang on to life about. I am just here.
-  Once I have more tech skills will find the time to update this page.
